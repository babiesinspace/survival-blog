The purpose of this blog is to feel out the potential for creating my own about my Fellowship experience.

Posts would focus on maintaining personal wellbeing and organization, achieving goals and staying on a budget during a stressful time.

I chose to focus on some backend design challenges and got side-tracked from writing any actual posts. My hope is to get back to writing this later.

In the meantime, please enjoy posts which are actually 'V for Vendetta' speeches, and comments which are Seinfeld quotes, courtesty of the Faker gem.

I'm proudest of the threaded-comment functionality I built out. I'm sure it's not perfect, and visually it doesn't come through (since I didn't focus on any styling), but it uses a bit of tree data-structuring and recursion.

I'm disappointed that I didn't have time to make it visually engaging - but the project still goes beyond the requirements of the assignment, so I figured I earned a bit of fun with logic problems.
